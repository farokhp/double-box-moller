The transformation matrix contains all information: MIs(pre-canonical), Linear combination for the MIs, normalization factors for diagonals and correction terms for Off diagonals.

The pre-canonical MIs first get transformed by linear combination terms, then by given transformation matrix, this gives final Mis to obtain canonical forms.

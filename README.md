The transformation matrix conatins all information: Linear combination for the MIs, correction for diagonals and Off diagonals

The pre-canonical MIs first get transformed by linear combination terms, then by given trasnfromation matrix

The linear combination are given separatly at the end of trasnfromation matrix.nb

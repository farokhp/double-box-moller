The transformation matrix contains all information: MIs(pre-canonical), Linear combination for the MIs, normalization factors for diagonals and correction terms for Off diagonals.

The pre-canonical MIs first get transformed by linear combination terms, then by given transformation matrix, this gives final Mis to obtain canonical forms.

The As and At matrices are canonical forms, once pure and once with Dlogs; Dlogs are already provided in Master Thesis.
